This work provides an extensive survey of the collaborative aspect of MASs and introduces an extensible framework to guide future research. Our framework characterizes collaboration mechanisms based on key dimensions: actors (agents involved), types (e.g., cooperation, competition, or coopetition), structures (e.g., peer-to-peer, centralized, or distributed), strategies (e.g., role-based or model-based), and coordination protocols.\\nThrough a review of existing methodologies, our findings serve as a foundation for demystifying and advancing LLM-based MASs toward more intelligent and collaborative solutions for complex, real-world use cases. In addition, various applications of MASs across diverse domains, including 5G/6G networks, Industry 5.0, question answering, and social and cultural settings, are also investigated, demonstrating their wider adoption and broader impacts. Finally, we identify key lessons learned, open challenges, and potential research directions of MASs towards artificial collective intelligence.\\nReference: Khanh-Tung Tran, Dung Dao, Minh-Duong', 'title': 'Multi-Agent Collaboration Mechanisms: A Survey of LLMs', 'url': 'https://arxiv.org/html/2501.06322v1'}, {'content': 'Sign up\\nSign in\\nSign up\\nSign in\\n--\\nListen\\nShare\\nOr how I learned to use Open AI Swarm on vacation thanks to my Cline companion programmer\\nI had sworn to my wife and daughter that I wouldn’t work during the All-Saints’ vacation. I told myself that at worst I’d be reading Medium and watching my favorite YouTube feeds. Comfortably seated at the Coco Lodge, in the beautiful Madagascan town of Mahajanga, I came across the announcement of the launch of Swarm, Open AI’s new agent development framework. I’ve been interested in this field since the 1980s, when people were still talking about Multi Agent Systems (MAS) and Artificial Intelligence still enduring its winter.\\nImmediately convinced of its usefulness, still intended for education and the facilitation of agent-based prototyping and development, I came up with a lazy idea, which is what every good developer should have. Why not use Cline (formerly Claude Dev), my favorite pair programmer, to learn the basics of the framework and code using Swarm at the same time. The lessons I’ve learned from it are confounding, to say the least, and I’d like to share them with you. As this essay is intended to be an overview of the hottest topics in agentic coding, it is a little long. It is also well documented and illustrated. That’s why I’ve divided it into three parts. The first will review the current state of agent-based and pair programming.

We also highlight major breakthroughs, open challenges, and industry adoption trends shaping this “society of AI minds.”\\nOne of the defining trends of 2024 — 2025 is the rise of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS). Instead of a single model trying to do everything, groups of specialized agents now cooperate to solve complex tasks.\\nAdvances in large language models have made it possible for multiple LLM-driven agents to perceive, reason, and act collaboratively, shifting AI from isolated single-model setups to interaction-centric approaches .

  - Agent: InformationRetrievalSpecialist_v1, Task: main_report_task_Minsky_retrieval, Status: completed_task, Details: Successfully retrieved and processed data for the future of multi-agent systems inspired by Minsky's Society of Mind., Output: [{'content': [{'content': 'With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), Agentic AI has become phenomenal in real-world applications, moving toward multiple LLM-based agents to perceive, learn, reason, and act collaboratively.\nThese LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) enable groups of intelligent agents to coordinate and solve complex tasks collectively at scale, transitioning from isolated models to collaboration-centric approaches. This work provides an extensive survey of the collaborative aspect of MASs and introduces an extensible framework to guide future research. Our framework characterizes collaboration mechanisms based on key dimensions: actors (agents involved), types (e.g., cooperation, competition, or coopetition), structures (e.g., peer-to-peer, centralized, or distributed), strategies (e.g., role-based or model-based), and coordination protocols.\nThrough a review of existing methodologies, our findings serve as a foundation for demystifying and advancing LLM-based MASs toward more intelligent and collaborative solutions for complex, real-world use cases. In addition, various applications of MASs across diverse domains, including 5G/6G networks, Industry 5.0, question answering, and social and cultural settings, are also investigated, demonstrating their wider adoption and broader impacts. Finally, we identify key lessons learned, open challenges, and potential research directions of MASs towards artificial collective intelligence.\nReference: Khanh-Tung Tran, Dung Dao, Minh-Duong', 'title': 'Multi-Agent Collaboration Mechanisms: A Survey of LLMs', 'url': 'https://arxiv.org/html/2501.06322v1'}, {'content': 'Sign up\nSign in\nSign up\nSign in\n--\nListen\nShare\nOr how I learned to use Open AI Swarm on vacation thanks to my Cline companion programmer\nI had sworn to my wife and daughter that I wouldn’t work during the All-Saints’ vacation. I told myself that at worst I’d be reading Medium and watching my favorite YouTube feeds. Comfortably seated at the Coco Lodge, in the beautiful Madagascan town of Mahajanga, I came across the announcement of the launch of Swarm, Open AI’s new agent development framework. I’ve been interested in this field since the 1980s, when people were still talking about Multi Agent Systems (MAS) and Artificial Intelligence still enduring its winter.\nImmediately convinced of its usefulness, still intended for education and the facilitation of agent-based prototyping and development, I came up with a lazy idea, which is what every good developer should have. Why not use Cline (formerly Claude Dev), my favorite pair programmer, to learn the basics of the framework and code using Swarm at the same time. The lessons I’ve learned from it are confounding, to say the least, and I’d like to share them with you. As this essay is intended to be an overview of the hottest topics in agentic coding, it is a little long. It is also well documented and illustrated. That’s why I’ve divided it into three parts. The first will review the current state of agent-based and pair programming. The second will focus on Swarm, and the third and final part will introduce Cline and my though', 'title': 'HolydAIs, learn and code Swarm with the help of Cline — Part 1/3 ...', 'url': 'https://medium.com/@pierreemmanuelfega/holydais-learn-and-code-swarm-with-the-help-of-cline-part-1-3-f9ba697551e3'}, {'content': 'Sign up\nSign in\nSign up\nSign in\n--\nListen\nShare\nLarge Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved rapidly in 2025, moving beyond simple chatbots to complex multi-agent systems that can plan, reason, and act with a high degree of autonomy.\nThese systems comprise multiple interacting AI “agents” that collaborate on tasks, which strikingly echoes ideas from Marvin Minsky’s The Society of Mind .\nMinsky’s 1986 theory envisioned intelligence as emerging from many small, specialized processes (agents) working in concert, rather than a single monolithic mind .\nThis comparison is especially apparent in how modern AI agents coordinate with each other, integrate symbolic reasoning with neural networks, and exhibit modular, distributed intelligence.\nBelow, we examine the latest architectures, frameworks, and applications of LLM-based agents, and how they incorporate Minsky’s vision of distributed cognition. We also highlight major breakthroughs, open challenges, and industry adoption trends shaping this “society of AI minds.”\nOne of the defining trends of 2024 — 2025 is the rise of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS). Instead of a single model trying to do everything, groups of specialized agents now cooperate to solve complex tasks.\nAdvances in large language models have made it possible for multiple LLM-driven agents to perceive, reason, and act collaboratively, shifting AI from isolated single-model setups to interaction-centric approaches .
